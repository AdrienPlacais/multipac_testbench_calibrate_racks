# How to install
From the folder where the scipt should be installed, run ``git clone https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/multipactor/calibrate_rf_racks.git``, or simply download and unzip the code wherever you want.
You must have a relatively recent version of Python (>3.7) and the libraries from `requirements.txt` installed.
